# Titanic Survival Analysis
## Overview

This project delves into the historical Titanic dataset to analyze and predict survival outcomes. The Titanic, often remembered for its fateful maiden voyage, provides a rich dataset for us to understand the social dynamics and survival factors during the disaster.

### Objective

To explore and understand the factors that influenced the survival rates of the Titanic passengers and to build a predictive model that can estimate survival chances under similar circumstances.

### Tools & Methods Used

    Python: Main programming language used for data cleaning, analysis, and machine learning.
    Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
    Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and exploratory data analysis.
    Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models, specifically the RandomForestClassifier.
    NumPy: For numerical computations.
    Cross-Validation: To validate the effectiveness of the predictive models.
    Statistical Testing: To assess the significance of the findings.

### Key Findings

    Social-economic status, represented by passenger class, 
    had a significant impact on survival chances.
    
    Women and children were more likely to survive, in line with the
    maritime disaster policy of "women and children first."
    
    Passengers embarking from different locations showed 
    different survival rates, with those from Cherbourg having a higher chance of survival.

### Model Performance

The RandomForestClassifier showed an accuracy score of approximately 80% with cross-validation, indicating a model that generalizes well and isn't overfitted to the training data.
