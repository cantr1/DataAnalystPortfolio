# Projects 

Below is an overview of select projects I have developed, showcasing my abilities in data analysis, visualization, and interpretation. Each project is aimed at delivering actionable insights to a specific audience, utilizing various data science techniques and tools.

Titanic Survival Analysis

    Objective: Uncover the factors that influenced survival rates during the 
    Titanic disaster and predict survival outcomes for similar maritime incidents.

    Tools & Methods:

    Python: Leveraged Python's data science libraries including pandas for data manipulation, 
    matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization, and scikit-learn 
    for implementing machine learning models.

    Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Conducted thorough preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, 
    feature encoding, and data transformation to prepare the dataset for analysis.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Employed statistical analysis and visualization 
    techniques to explore the relationships between passenger attributes (like sex, age, class) and survival rates.

    Machine Learning Modeling: Developed a RandomForestClassifier to predict survival outcomes.
    Utilized hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance.

    Cross-Validation: Implemented k-fold cross-validation to assess model 
    obustness and ensure reliability in prediction across various data segments.

    Statistical Testing: Performed hypothesis testing to determine the statistical 
    significance of observed patterns, particularly in relation to passenger embarkation points and survival rates.
    
Apple App Store Data Analysis

    Objective: Provide actionable insights to aspiring software developers on market trends.
    
    Tools & Methods:

        SQL: Executed complex queries to extract and analyze key data points from the App Store dataset.
    
        Analysis: Identified popular categories, trends in user ratings, 
        and pricing strategies that correlate with higher user ratings and engagement.

    

Israel-Palestine Casualties in Gaza Data Analysis

    Objective: Offer comprehensive insights into the conflict's human impact for educators, historians, and policymakers.
    
    Tools & Methods:

        Python: Employed data manipulation libraries (pandas) to cleanse and structure casualty data.
    
        Tableau: Created compelling visualizations to depict the temporal and demographic distribution of 
        casualties, enhancing understanding of the conflict's human toll.


Heart Disease Analysis in the American Population

    Objective: Aid healthcare professionals and patients in understanding and preventing heart disease, 
    a leading health concern in the USA.
    
    Tools & Methods:
    
        Python: Conducted correlational analysis with Seaborn and 
        created visualizations with MatPlotLib to identify risk factors associated with heart disease.
    
        Insights: Compiled a report detailing the relationship between key heart health metrics
        and the prevalence of heart disease to inform preventative care strategies.

Cyber Security Salary Analysis Project

    Objective: Provide valuable insights into the salary trends and disparities in the cyber security industry, 
    aimed at guiding professionals, recruiters, and industry analysts. 
    
    Tools & Methods:

        Jupyter: Utilized as the primary interactive development environment for exploratory data analysis 
        and visualization. Enabled seamless integration of code, visual output, and narrative text.

        Python: Leveraged for robust data processing and analysis. 
        Utilized libraries such as pandas for data manipulation and NumPy for numerical computations.

        Matplotlib (MPL) & Seaborn (SNS): Employed for creating detailed and informative visualizations. 
        Designed graphs and charts to illustrate salary trends, employment variations,
