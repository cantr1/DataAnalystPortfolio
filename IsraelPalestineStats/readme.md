README for the Gaza Conflict Data Analysis Project

- Project Overview

This project involves a thorough data analysis of the conflict in Israel/Palestine, with a particular focus on the Gaza region. By employing robust data analysis techniques, the project aims to shed light on the conflict's dynamics, providing an objective view that can help inform public understanding of this complex issue.

- Target Audience

The analysis is targeted at the data community, policymakers, conflict analysts, humanitarian aid organizations, educators, and anyone seeking a data-driven understanding of the conflict in Gaza.

- Key Findings

The project revealed several significant insights:

    Combatant vs. Civilian Fatalities: A notable portion of the fatalities within the dataset were identified 
    as participants in hostilities, highlighting the intense nature of the conflict. 
    However, a majority of casualties were civilians, underlining the tragic toll on the non-combatant population.

    Means of Warfare: Missiles emerged as the leading cause of fatalities, 
    with other types of ammunition like live rounds, phosphorus shells, 
    and mortars also resulting in significant death tolls.

    Fluctuations Over Time: There was a spike in fatalities in 2008, 
    and while there has been a downward trend in recent years, 
    intermittent surges in casualties have occurred, 
    reflecting the ongoing conflict and the absence of a lasting resolution.

- Methodology

Data Preparation and Cleaning

    Python & Jupyter Notebook: Initial data processing was done using Python within Jupyter Notebooks. 
    With pandas, the data was cleaned, transformed, and made ready for detailed analysis.

Data Analysis and Sharing

    Excel: The cleaned data was exported to Excel, which provided a universally 
    accessible format for data viewing and further import into analytical tools.

Data Visualization

    Tableau: Tableau was the tool of choice for visual storytelling. 
    The toolâ€™s advanced visualization capabilities 
    were leveraged to illustrate the conflict's patterns and trends, 
    presenting a narrative that is understandable and insightful.

- Tools Used

The following tools were used for this analysis:

    Python & Jupyter Notebook for data processing
    Pandas library for data manipulation
    Excel for data organization and sharing
    Tableau for data visualization and storytelling
